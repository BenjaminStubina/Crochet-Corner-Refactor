Crochet Corner was the first full-stack project I developed as my Capstone project while at BrainStation. The project was originally created in React with a NodeJS/Express backend.

The backend heavily relied on storing and reading data in JSON files, something that proved to be very inefficient. As well, both front-end and back-end functionality-related code quality wasn't as optimal as I would have liked it to be. 

The goal of this project is to recreate my original project and deploy it while improving code quality and efficiency. A few changes to the original project include:
- Using TailwindCSS instead of SASS
- Use MongoDB for backend functionality (storing stitch data, favourites, and API calls from frontend will fetch data from the DB)
- Use Vite
- Deploy the project
